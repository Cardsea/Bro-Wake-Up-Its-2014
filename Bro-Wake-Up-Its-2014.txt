Bro. Wake up. it's 2014	

The world outside was a mess — chaos everywhere. Everything felt broken, like reality itself was fraying at the edges. Eli was stuck in that nightmare, just trying to keep his head above water in a place that didn’t make sense anymore.

Then, out of nowhere, Eli hears a weird sound. Like a distant whisper calling his name. The room spins, his vision blurs, and he collapses — blackness swallowing him whole.

⸻

When Eli finally opens his eyes, he’s somewhere… different.

It’s his childhood bedroom. Everything’s exactly how he remembers it — the posters on the walls, the old gaming console by his desk, the worn-out blanket folded at the foot of his bed. 

Eli sits up slowly, clarity flooding his mind.

“Who are you?” Eli asks a voice he barely recognizes.

His brother steps forward, a gentle smile on his face.
“I’m your brother. You’ve been asleep for a while — four hours. You okay, Eli?”

Eli blinks, trying to process.
“No way… I’m really back in my room?”

His brother laughs softly, the sound warm and familiar.
“Yeah, dingus. You just took a nap. You look kinda out of it — feeling discombobulated?”

Eli runs a hand through his hair, still stunned.
“Look, I don’t mean to sound dumb, but… what year is it?”

His brother grins, like this is the funniest thing ever.
“Haha! It’s 2014, silly! You must’ve napped too long. You seem pretty mixed up. Anyway, Mom made dinner. You woke up just in time.”

⸻

Then it hits Eli like a punch to the gut.

His mom? She’d been gone for a quarter of his life. Not just gone — dead.

Eli freezes, the room suddenly too small, too quiet.

“Wait… Mom’s back?” His voice cracks. Tears threaten to spill.

His brother’s smile is steady and real.
“Yeah, of course. She didn’t go anywhere — just to the store. But she just got back. She’s making dinner.”

Eli’s eyes well up. Without thinking, he bolts from his bed and runs into the living room, where she is — just like he remembers. Same smile, same warmth.

He throws his arms around her, holding on tight, like if Eli lets go she’ll disappear again.

Scene: Living Room — Early Evening

Eli sits on the couch, staring at the quiet hallway.

After a long pause, his voice barely above a whisper, he asks,  
“Where’s Dad?”

His brother’s eyes flicker with pain. He looks away for a moment, swallowing hard.  
“He… isn’t here anymore, Eli.”

Eli’s chest tightens, and his hands tremble.  
“What do you mean? He can’t just be gone.”

The brother’s voice cracks a little.  
“He left. Before everything got bad. Before you… before all this.”

Eli’s eyes fill with tears, his breath catching.  
“I don’t remember him. Not really. I’m scared I never will.”

His brother sits beside him, placing a shaky hand on his shoulder.  
“I know, man. Me too. But I’m here now. We have each other.”

Eli nods, wiping tears he didn’t know he was holding back.  
“I just… wish things were different.”

His brother’s voice is soft but steady.  
“Me too, Eli. Me too.”

⸻

But this moment isn’t fragile or fleeting.

Because now, Eli knows this is real. This is life — his real life.

⸻

Scene: Late Evening

Eli lies awake, staring at the ceiling. The shadows flicker like ghosts of the past.

His brother’s voice comes from the next room, softer now.
“You okay, Eli?”

Eli swallows hard.
“Yeah. I just… I needed this. It’s real. Finally.”

The brother nods, understanding.
“Sometimes, coming back is the hardest part.”

⸻

Scene: Morning

Sunlight filters through the curtains. Eli wakes up again, sure now that this is reality.

He looks at the calendar on the wall — it really says 2014.

For a moment, everything feels possible. Like maybe, just maybe, Eli’s life from here on is truly his own.

⸻

There’s a strange weight in that — the truth settling in.

The life he thought was real was the illusion. Now he’s awake — really awake — in 2014, where it all begins again.

---

He steps out onto the porch, feeling the cool air of spring 2014 on his skin. The sky is bright, untouched by everything he thought he had lived through. No endless news cycles, no social collapse, no lost friends.

Just birds. The smell of grass. A neighbor’s lawnmower in the distance.

Eli sits on the porch steps and just breathes. Deep, real, steady breaths.

In his pocket, his phone buzzes.

It’s not a smartphone. Just the old flip phone he used to carry everywhere. He opens it — there’s no messages. No missed calls. Just the default wallpaper and the date:

**April 3, 2014.**

He smiles.

For the first time in what felt like forever, Eli isn’t afraid of what comes next.

He’s got time now. Time to do it all differently.

⸻

Scene: That Afternoon

Eli is in the garage, poking around at old boxes full of his childhood stuff. He pulls out an old sketchbook and flips through it. There are doodles, ideas for games he never made, notes to himself.

It all feels so... light. Like breathing clean air after drowning.

His brother walks in, sipping a juice pouch.

“You good?”

Eli laughs. “I’m... yeah. I’m good. I just forgot who I used to be.”

His brother nods. “Welcome back, dude.”

⸻

Scene: That Night — The Dream

Later, they sit on the roof of their house, looking up at the stars.

Eli is quiet for a long time before he finally speaks.

“Do you know what I saw?” he says softly. “In the dream?”

His brother shakes his head. “No. Just that you were gone a long time.”

Eli swallowed hard, his voice barely more than a whisper.
“It was… brutal. The year was 2025, but it felt like the world was unraveling faster than anyone could keep up. Streets once alive were now empty echoes of fear. People didn’t just hate each other—they feared each other, like strangers with knives behind every smile. Trust was a myth, safety a ghost. The sky was gray all the time, like the world itself was holding its breath.
Mom… she was gone. Like a light snuffed out, leaving everything darker. You had grown older, older, but distant. We drifted apart, lost in the noise and the silence between words. We didn’t talk anymore. Not really. Everything around us was so cold, so loud with chaos, and every moment felt fake—like life had been reduced to a grim performance nobody wanted to watch but couldn’t look away from.”

His brother stays silent, letting him speak.

“I kept thinking it was real. That there was no way back. I stopped hoping.”

He wipes his eyes, not caring if the tears fall.

“The world was shredded — like the whole damn system just fell apart. Politicians lying through their teeth, pushing their own agendas while people got left behind, lost in the mess. Wars nobody cared about except the ones losing everything. The news wasn’t news anymore — just fear, hate, and lies on repeat, like some broken record stuck on doom. Trust vanished. No one believed cops, leaders, or even their neighbors. The economy crashed so hard no one could find a job or even buy food without selling their soul. The streets? Hell no. Gangs ran wild, and the government was too busy tearing itself apart to fix a damn thing.”

He takes a shaky breath, swallowing the lump in his throat.
“Everyone was scared all the damn time. Nobody slept without nightmares. We lost family, friends… Mom was gone. You were older, but distant — like we were strangers sharing a memory. The world got cold, loud, fake — like life was just a bad show we all had to pretend to watch, waiting for the next disaster to hit.”

“But now I’m here. And you’re here. And Mom’s cooking dinner like nothing happened.”

His brother puts a hand on his shoulder.

“Well. To be honest. Nothing did happen for us.. But you’re here now. That’s what matters.”

Eli nods, looking back up at the stars.

“How can I trust myself to go to sleep without getting lost again. I lived a whole life. A terible life. It was all a dream though
